Hello, I am Yinyun Huang(in chinese character "黄胤云"), an undergraduate major in Computer Science.<br>
I am interested in NLP when I was a sophomore, later I find that engineering attract me more, so I decide to join the industry instead of purse  research based graduate education.<br>
Due to the pandemic of Covid-19, I just experience normal college life about half-year, then endless lockdown comes into my life, and I'd like to work abroad. Hence, I am expected to enroll to some Master Program provided by Universities of North America.<br>
I join [AntNLP](antnlp.org) as a Research intern during june 2021 to Sep 2021 for a multi-modal research.<br>
I join HUAWEICLOUD as a software engineer intern during june 2022 to Aug 2022, focusing on development of middleware of microservice using Rust.<br>
Glad to see you!<br>
