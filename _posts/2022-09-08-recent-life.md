These days I'm not happy.<br>
So many incredible things happens in this country which I am similar to. It just is loop, these things happens again and again, but it seems like that a few people can remember it.<br>
Obviously I'm tired of this type of life, I need get into another environment.<br>
Not anything can make my happy.<br>
The last year of my undergraduate looks like will be even worse.<br>
